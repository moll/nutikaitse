When creating an application, one must make sure that used third party ready-made software components are secure. One also has to ensure that related online services are secured.

Mobile apps may be given automatic access to paid functions such as phone calls, SMSs and MMSs, roaming data, NFC payments, etc. In creating such privileged access applications, possible fraudulent uses must be considered particularly carefully. Applications must be analyzed for potential weak spots and the opportunities they give to possible attackers and how to limit access to paid services.

Secure distributing of applications through official distribution channels is important. Official application stores should be preferred, for they provide the user with the updates and tend to provide additional safety checks and measures.
