Attention must be given to user authentication. It also has to be ensured that the user session of a user authenticated in a mobile app would be protected and impossible to take over.

In secure handling of passwords, it must be considered that in addition to security measures employed in app development, much is dependent on how users protect their own devices, i.e. on the screen lock and PIN codes chosen, on biometrical authentication methods chosen, on using different passwords for various services, and on how users physically protect their devices to keep them from falling into strangers’ hands or to keep them from getting lost.
