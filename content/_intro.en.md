Mobile App Secure Development Guidelines and Mobile App Platform Requirements were compiled on the request of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications and for the description of activities specified in the Government of the Republic’s action programme (ratified in 2011). The aforementioned activities include developing security requirements for e-services used in mobile devices and specifying requirements for operating system and browser interoperability.
