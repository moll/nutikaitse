title: 2-Factor Authentication
---
If necessary, 2 factor authentication should be considered, i.e. adding additional security measures to the authentication process, e.g. SMS verification codes, using a special key generation application or a PIN calculator. If necessary, CAPTCHA code may be added for human detection.

If using verification codes, it is advisable that the developer of the application or the client inquire from every target marketâ€™s mobile operator whether the local operators and service provider used for sending SMSs have corresponding service contracts to ensure that SMSs containing authentication codes reach end-users.
