title: "Third Party Data"
---
Special attention should be given to data accepted from or sent to all unreliable third-party applications (e.g. advertising software)

As with components, data should be considered unsecure by default. Whether the structure, types, and values of the data correspond to expectations should be checked prior to using received data. Whitelisting, or only permitting suitable data, is generally more secure than blacklisting, or banning unsuitable data. In case of the latter, something unanticipated may get through.
