title: "Application Permissions"
---
In order to work on a mobile device, applications tend to need a set of permissions from a user. Before requesting any particular permission, its necessity should be carefully considered. It's safer to refrain from asking for permissions "just in case" if they are actually not necessary for the application to work. The user should have access to precise explanations why an app needs its permissions.
