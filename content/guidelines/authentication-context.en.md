title: "Authentication Context"
---
In order to make authentication more secure, it is possible to follow context: the device's identifier, IP-addresses, etc. If the application identifies an unanticipated change in the context (e.g. a change in the IP-address location country), it is advisable to implement additional authentication measures.
