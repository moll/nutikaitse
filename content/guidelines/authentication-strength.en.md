title: "Strength of Authentication Mechanism"
---
The strength of the authentication mechanism used to enter an application must be contingent on the sensitivity of the data the application processes (e.g. personal information, financial operations). The combination of the applicationâ€™s own username and password is the weakest authentication mechanism. When users choose their passwords, it is best to give instant feedback on the strength of the inserted password.
