As far as possible, the security and authenticity of all the used pre-made components should be checked. Make sure whether the components come from a reliable source and that they do not contain possible back doors and malware. This includes both libraries and source code copied from the Internet.

It is better to separate components obtained from other parties in such a way that the security holes in them would not put the application at risk. For example, integrated web views or advertisement banners should not be given access to the application's internal functions.
