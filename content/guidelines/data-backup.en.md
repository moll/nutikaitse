title: "Data Backup"
---
Only encrypted or hashed versions of passwords and authorization tokens must be included in regular data backup. It must be taken into consideration that the strength of any encrypting or hashing algorithm weakens over time. Thus, backup copies containing encrypted data must not be stored longer than the effective use time of the encrypting algorithm.
