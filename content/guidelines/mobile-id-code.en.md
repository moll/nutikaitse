title: Mobile-ID Confirmation Code
---
The Mobile-ID confirmation code shown for authenticating or digital signatures should be positioned so it's visible clearly and remain visible until the authentication is complete. The ability to compare the code shown in a mobile app with the one shown on the Mobile-ID SIM-card application before entering one's PIN is required by the Mobile-ID standard and permits the user to confirm whether they're signin in to the service they're expecting. We shouldn't cultivate a habit of ignoring it.
