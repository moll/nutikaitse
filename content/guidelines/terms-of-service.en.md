title: Terms of Service
---
There are two main ways to confirm the terms of service with the user:

1. At the time of installation;
2. At the time of running, before transmitting sensitive personal data.

Legally the correct approach would one of "opt-in", as opposed to "opt-out". That is, the user must knowlingly, and through a concious action, agree. Agreement by default, thereby through inaction, isn't considered accepting the terms.
